      <p style="font-family:time" align="justify"><font size="3">MetaXplore, an interactive user-friendly platform that enables the discovery and visualization of microbial sequencing data. It provides a set of well-documented choices of downstream analysis classified in the following sections: </p>
      <ul style="font-family:time" align="justify">
        <li><b>Import Data:</b> Determine the dataset to use as the starting point of the analysis. </li>
        <li><b>Alpha Diversity:</b> Calculate alpha diversity indices among samples and visualize indices in boxplots with significant differences between the groups. </li>
        <li><b>Beta Diversity:</b> Calculate the beta-diversity between samples and visualize groupings of samples according to a given category. </li>
        <li><b>Relative Abundance:</b> calculate relative abundance matrix and produce abundance stacked bar chart, heatmap, and bar chart for different taxonomy levels according to a given category.  </li>
        <li><b>Differential abundance :</b> Test the significant variation in OTUs abundance at different taxonomic levels.</li>
	<li><b>Core microbiome:</b> Identify the core OTUs based on the percentage of occurrence in samples and their abundance.</li>
	<li><b>Biomarker discovery:</b> Identify the discriminant taxa between groups of samples.</li>
      </ul>
